# 🚀 Welcome to CyberStack

**CyberStack** is a forward-driven engineering collective building next-gen, secure, and modular software — from full-stack platforms to advanced cybersecurity systems. We specialize in **future-ready development**, blending clean architecture with real-world performance.

> We don’t just build software. We architect innovation.

## 🧩 What We Build

### 🌐 Full-Stack Web Platforms
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA), SSR, and dynamic SPAs
- Headless eCommerce, CMS, and custom API-first backends
- Seamless integrations with **Laravel**, **Nuxt**, **Vue**, **TypeScript**, and more

### 🔐 Secure Software Systems
- Tokenized auth flows (OAuth2, JWT, Device Tokens)
- API Rate Limiting, Role/Permission Management (RBAC/ABAC)
- Real-time monitoring with **Telescope**, **Sentry**, and custom dashboards

### ⚙️ DevOps & Automation
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), Dockerized Environments
- CI/CD Pipelines for zero-downtime deployments
- Scalable microservice orchestration & serverless functions

### 🧪 Developer Experience (DX)
- Modular, typed packages with strict architecture rules
- Reusable components & domain-driven design (DDD)
- Full **unit**, **feature**, and **integration** test coverage with CI pipelines

## 🛠️ Open-Source Philosophy

We believe in **clean code**, **open collaboration**, and **scalable engineering**.  
Every repository we publish is designed to be:
- 📦 **Modular**: Easy to adopt, extend, or replace
- 🧼 **Readable**: Well-documented and developer-friendly
- 🧪 **Tested**: CI-ready with sample data, seeders, and Postman collections
- 🔁 **Reusable**: Across teams, contexts, and projects

## 👥 Our Engineering Culture

- 💡 _"Architecture over hacks."_  
- 🔁 _"Reusable > Redundant."_  
- 🔐 _"Security is a feature, not an afterthought."_  
- 🚀 _"Launch early. Refactor often."_  
- ⚙️ _"Automate everything that repeats twice."_
